# Wrist Rehabilitation Device
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!
You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

![Headstone Image](FinalCircuit)

Description:
I wanted to make it so that the data was easily accesible. I started looking for options to make it a website. I found a website that would be able to do that called adafruit.io. I made the webite include an output for each value with timestamps and a light that detects if the user is bending their wrist at a bad angle or not. I will also eventually add the vibration sensors to help people use it weithout the website. The website will only be for longer term data and attempting to identify long-term improvement. 

Challenges:
Whenever I would send data to the website, it would exceed the limit for how much data could be processed. Due to this, Adafruit IO would ban me for a short period of time. To solve this I used millis() which counts how much time has elapsed since the code started running. By doing this, I was able to identify how to make it use the most amount of data I could without gettting banned.

Next Steps:
I need to still add the vibration and speakers to alert the user, sew it all onto the glove, and soldering it all on the final breadboard.

# First Milestone

My First milestone was to be able to accurately receive data fromt he flex sensor with a high accuracy. For example, I had to find the angle of the bend in the flex sensor:
(FlexCircuit)

Description:
So far, I've understood how the flex sensor works and how the accelrometer works. However, I've only identified how to use the flex sensor and receive an accurate angle. To do that I plotted the data I received from bending the flex sensor at a certain angle. Below is the function that I created from the data:
Graph:
(Graph)
y1 = m * (a * x1 - b) + c1 * cos(f1 * x1 + p1)+ c2 * cos(f2 * x1 + p2) + c3 * cos(f3 * x1 + p3) + c4 * cos(f4 * x4 + p4) + c5 * cos(f5 * x1 + p5) + c6 * cos(f6 * x1 + p6) + c7 * cos(f7 * x1 + p7) + c8 * cos(f8 * x1 + p8)
I used this equation so that the graph was fit to my data very tightly. This makes it so that I have a 99.85% accuracy relative to my data. This means that it isn't 99.85% accurate to the actual angle but the angles that I measured instead. I did this because I was pretty confident with my measurements as I took around 50 measurements.

Challenges:
Some challenges I faced were identifying how to make an equation that matches it. Once I learned about using C * cos (f * x + p) I added more until the acccuracy reached its highest. Another challenge I faced was when taking measurements, the sensor would return values that don't make any sense that are way too high ot low. To solve this, I took many measurements and averaged them. I also had taken the average of the last ten valeus when actually writing the code to exclude outliers and make it more accurate.

Next Steps:
Next, I want to find a way to use the accelerometer and then transfer the data from both sensors by Wifi.


# Starter Project - Retro Arcade Console

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HoTiaGMx5EQ?si=7KrHkXm_49cLGxsC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Description:
In the starter project, I created a retro arcade console. First, I soldered on the LED displays which would be the screen and score display. Then, I soldered the USB port to be able to change the data in the microcontroller. Then, I soldered on the buttons for input. Next I attached the battery pack to the back case, trimmed the wires, and attached the wires to allow for power. I added the capicator and cut off the extra metal since it stuck out very far. The switch was placed between the power and the rest of the circuit to be able ot turn the power on and off. Finally, I added a vibrator to add a new effect. When creating this project I learn't how to sauter, desauter, and splice wires.

Challenges:
My biggest challenges were that I had to restart the starter project twice. The first time I accidently melted the switch with the soldering gun while working on soldering the wires. The switch was already solered on the board and wouldn't budge even after desoldering. The second time I had placed the displays upside down and so the polarity of the displays got messed up. The displays also wouldn't get desoldered after an hour of trying. On the third attempt, I finally finished the project.

Next Steps:
My next steps will be to understand how the parts for my main project work and how I can use them to make my wrist rehabilitation device. Then, I will have to find a way to accuratly measure the angle of the device

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
