</figure>


**Description:**
I have added vibration motors, a 16-LED ring, and an arm sleeve. The vibration motors and the LED ring will be used in a way to assist the user in identifying where the issue is coming from. The vibration motors will buzz on that side of the hand, and the LED ring will point in the direction of the issue. I've split the directions into left, right, up, and down in the code by checking if the difference is positive or negative. The arm sleeve is used to move the parts like the ESP-32 and the breadboard onto the arm, where it feels less heavy on the user's wrist, and to keep them not all clumping together.

**Challenges:**
Some challenges I faced were having to figure out how to split the directions into left, right, up, and down. This was because I had to break apart the code I already had, rewriting the whole piece. 

**Next Steps:**

# Second Milestone

**Description:**
I have installed two 9-axis IMUs. One was installed at the side of the hand, and one was installed at the side of the forearm. I did this to be able to differentiate linear movement from wrist movement. First, I would translate the acceleration, angular speed, and magnometry into roll, pitch, and yaw using the Madgwick filter. If there was a difference between the two sensors' rolls, pitches, and yaws, they would need to have moved their wrist, and if not, they just moved their arm linearly. I wanted to ensure that the data was easily accessible. I began searching for options to create a website. I found a system that would be able to do that called adafruit.io. I made the website include an output for each value with timestamps and a light that detects if the user is bending their wrist at a bad angle or not. I will also eventually add the vibration sensors to help people use it without the website. The website will only be used for long-term data collection and the identification of long-term improvement. I made the website public, making it so anyone can access it with the link and see the data.

**Challenges:**
When installing the IMUs, I had to find a way to differentiate the two sensors' data from each other. To do this, I had them both go into the same port with different filters and variables. Whenever I would send data to the website, it would exceed the limit for how much data could be processed. Due to this, Adafruit IO would ban me for a short period of time. To solve this, I used millis(), which counts how much time has elapsed since the code started running. By doing this, I was able to identify how to make it use the most amount of data I could without getting banned. I made it so that the data sends every 12 seconds to the website. This was alright because it is only for long-term data tracking, while the buzzers and vibrators help with short-term and immediately alerting the user.

**Next Steps:**
I need to still add the vibration and speakers to alert the user, sew it all onto the glove, solder it all onto the final breadboard, and also finish the modifications.

# First Milestone

**Description:**

My first milestone was to be able to accurately receive data from the flex sensor with high accuracy. For example, I had to find the angle of the bend in the flex sensor:

<figure>
  <img src="FlexCircuit">
  <figcaption>This is an image of my circuit, including a flex sensor and basic wiring to the ESP-32</figcaption>
</figure>

So far, I've understood how the flex sensor works and how the accelerometer works. However, I've only identified how to use the flex sensor and receive an accurate angle. To do that, I plotted the data I received from bending the flex sensor at a certain angle. Below is the function and graph that I created from the data:

<figure>
  <img src="Graph">
  <figcaption>This is my graph of data received from the flex sensor on the X-axis and the angle on the Y-axis.</figcaption>
</figure>

$y = m * (a * x - b) + \sum_{i=1}^8 ci * cos(fi * x + pi)$

This equation is made by taking the base equation and using the cosine to fit the data more accurately. We use cosine because in the data it makes the shape of a cosine curve. I used this equation so that the graph would fit my data very tightly. This makes it so that I have a 99.85% accuracy relative to my data. This means that it isn't 99.85% accurate to the actual angle, but rather the angles that I measured. I did this because I was pretty confident with my measurements, as I took around 50 measurements.

**Challenges:**
Some challenges I faced were identifying how to make an equation that matches it. Once I learned about using C * cos (f * x + p), I added more until the accuracy reached its highest. Another challenge I faced was when taking measurements, the sensor would return values that don't make any sense, that are way too high ot low. To solve this, I took many measurements to reduce experimental error. I also took the average of the last ten values when writing the code to exclude outliers and make it more accurate.

**Next Steps:**
Next, I want to find a way to use the accelerometers to identify the angles between them. Then, I would like to transfer the data from both sensors via Wifi.


# Starter Project - Retro Arcade Console

</figure>

**Description:**
In the starter project, I created a retro arcade console. First, I soldered on the LED displays, which would be the screen and score display. Then, I soldered the USB port to be able to change the data in the microcontroller. Then, I soldered on the buttons for input. Next, I attached the battery pack to the back case, trimmed the wires, and attached the wires to allow for power. I added the capacitor and cut off the extra metal since it stuck out very far. The switch was placed between the power and the rest of the circuit to be able ot turn the power on and off. Finally, I added a vibrator to add a new effect. When creating this project, I learned how to sauter, desauter, and splice wires.

**Challenges:**
My biggest challenge was that I had to restart the starter project twice. The first time I accidentally melted the switch with the soldering gun while working on soldering the wires. The switch was already soldered on the board and wouldn't budge even after desoldering. The second time, I had placed the displays upside down,n and so the polarity of the displays got messed up. The displays also wouldn't get desoldered after an hour of trying. On the third attempt, I finally finished the project.

**Next Steps:**
My next steps will be to understand how the parts for my main project work and how I can use them to make my wrist rehabilitation device. Then, I will have to find a way to accurately measure the angle of the device.
