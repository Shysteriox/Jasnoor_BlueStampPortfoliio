# Wrist Rehabilitation Device
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# Starter Project - Retro Arcade Console

Description:
In the starter project, I created a retro arcade console. First, I soldered on the LED displays which would be the screen and score display. Then, I soldered the USB port to be able to change the data in the microcontroller. Then, I soldered on the buttons for input. Next I attached the battery pack to the back case, trimmed the wires, and attached the wires to allow for power. I added the capicator and cut off the extra metal since it stuck out very far. The switch was placed between the power and the rest of the circuit to be able ot turn the power on and off. Finally, I added a vibrator to add a new effect. When creating this project I learn't how to sauter, desauter, and splice wires.

Challenges:
My biggest challenges were that I had to restart the starter project twice. The first time I accidently melted the switch with the soldering gun while working on soldering the wires. The switch was already solered on the board and wouldn't budge even after desoldering. The second time I had placed the displays upside down and so the polarity of the displays got messed up. The displays also wouldn't get desoldered after an hour of trying. On the third attempt, I finally finished the project.

Next Steps:
My next steps will be to understand how the parts for my main project work and how I can use them to make my wrist rehabilitation device. Then, I will have to find a way to accuratly measure the angle of the device

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
